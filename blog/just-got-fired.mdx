“This MF paid for Twitter”
No, I didn’t pay for Twitter.
I paid for free speech.
I paid for 1776 to commence again.
I paid for the Founding Fathers’ vision.
I paid to tell Silicon Valley to go screw itself.
I paid to show support for a man who put himself in the line of fire for the First Amendment.
I paid because we support our own.
I paid because if George Washington was alive today, he’d be paying too.
So next time you say I paid for Twitter, just realize how IGNANT (or ignorant, depending on your preference) you sound!
